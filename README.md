# RT-Select-General Data

This repo collects the data presented in papers
"Energy-Efficient Radio Selection and Data Partitioning for Real-Time Data Transfer" (DCOSS'19) and
"Radio Selection and Data Partitioning for Energy-Efficient Wireless Data Transfer in Real-Time IoT Applications" (Ad Hoc Networks '20).

## General Experiments
1. The energy consumption and deadline miss rates collected when using RT-Select-General and the baseline approaches on two radios and five radios;
2. The energy consumption simulated under the combinations of traffic demand and deadline requirement.

## Execution Time
The algorithm execution time using RT-Select-General and the baseline approaches with random radio characteristics when the number of radios is from 2 to 16.

## Traffic Balancing
Timestamps recorded when transmissions start and finish using RT-Select-General and RT-Balance for tight deadlines.
The difference of the timestamps can be used to determine whether the deadline is missed.
